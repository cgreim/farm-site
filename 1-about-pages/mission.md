<p class="quote">Corner Farm is a meeting place, a classroom, an outdoor laboratory, an art gallery, and a much-needed green space in our neighborhood. Our goal is to cultivate not just a garden, but also a <em>community</em>.</p>

## History

The Altgeld/Sawyer Corner Farm was started in 2008 by a small group of Logan Square neighbors. On a city lot that stood vacant for the previous 30 years, we envisioned a community space for exploring urban farming and artistic expression. The first iteration of the farm featured a small collection of vegetable beds and variety of fiber plants which were used for paper making.

In 2009, we partnered with Christopher House, an education center for local families, located just across the street from the garden. The fresh food we grow is donated to many families in need, and we help provide an educational space for the young students of Christopher House.

Since then, we’ve turned the vacant lot into a community green space that provides fresh foods to Christopher House’s food pantry and a community resource that helps neighbors come together to benefit Logan Square.
