      <td>So many flies!</td>
      <td>Not enough browns, and/or needs to be stirred.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Worms are trying to escape</td>
      <td>Too wet, too dry, or too hot. If too hot/dry, turn and add some water. The compost should be about as wet as a wrung out sponge; damp but not soaking.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bad odor—like rancid butter, vinegar, or rotten eggs</td>
      <td>Not enough oxygen, too wet, or too compacted. Turn the pile and add coarse dry materials such as leaves, straw, or corn stalks to soak up excessive moisture.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bad odor—like ammonia</td>
      <td>Too much nitrogen. Add materials high in carbon (such as shredded leaves, nontreated wood chips, sawdust, or shredded newsprint) and aerate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Compost pile has earwigs, slugs, and/or other insects</td>
      <td>All good! Insects are a good sign of a productive compost pile.</td>
